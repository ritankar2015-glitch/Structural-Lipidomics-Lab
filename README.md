# Structural-Lipidomics-Lab
We explore the molecular blueprint of life-threatening diseases—unraveling protein structures with cryo-EM and X-ray to reveal how they drive heart disease, fatty liver, and neurodegeneration. By decoding structure–function, we aim to spark innovative therapies and new hope against CVD, NAFLD, and Alzheimer’s.
